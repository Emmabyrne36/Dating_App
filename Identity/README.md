# Dating App with Identity

This is an updated version of the dating app which uses Identity and Role Management provided by .NET Core. This version of the application also has an additional moderator feature where admins and moderators have to approve or reject photos that a user uploads. When a user uplaods a photo, it cannot be seen by any other users until it has been approved by an admin or a moderator.
